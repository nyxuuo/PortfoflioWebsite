# Portfolio
A website containing my previous projects and information about myself for my portfolio! 
I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JS, and illustrations are made by me, but the patterns are taken from pinterest.

-> this will be deployed in Vercel, and the link will be attached after deployment.

## To view manually:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the file at src, type "cmd /k code ." and the project should open after that
3. Run live server to view the project :)
